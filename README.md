#SpEAR Database       
http://ee.ogi.edu/NSEL/     (Beta Release v1.0) 


---

The SpEAR Datbase contains carefully selected samples of noise
corrupted speech with clean speech references. This beta version is a
small initial release of the database to allow feedback for future
developments of this resource.

All speech and noise sources have been acoustically combined and
re-recorded.  Synchronous clocking is used to provide an exact
time-aligned reference to the clean speech signal (see Technical
Details).

Contents:

- Original Speech Files (TIMIT/)

- Noisy Speech Recordings (Noisy_Recordings/)- Recorded speech and
recorded noise: acoustically combined and re-recorded. Various noise
sources and different SNR levels.

- Lombard Speech (Lombard/) - Live speech in a noisy
environment. Recorded noise sources are used to allow extraction of a
cleaned speech reference.

- Monaural Recordings (Monaural/) - Two recorded speech signals:
acoustically combined and re-recorded.

Future releases will contain a more substantial number of samples,
additional additive noise sources, cellular and coding noise, etc.

Use of this data is free, but should be referenced in all publications
